# hjkleroids

Very small Python game.

Made mainly to learn Vim, so you move with **hjkl**.
You also shoot with `;`, btw. Tough luck.

The bullets are circles because collision is hard.  
You can go off screen to keep you on your toes (and because I got bored).

P.S. This is the best I could do. Ship moves, give me a break.
